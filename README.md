## Abstract

_In response to the contemporary demands of efficient financial management and religious obligations, this project presents the development of the "Web-Based Invoicing and Zakat Tracking System." This system, utilizing React for the user interface and Google's Firestore as the database backend, empowers small-scale businesses with streamlined invoice management, payment tracking, and zakat calculations, adhering to the Maliki school of thought. Employing intuitive interfaces, administrators can ensure secure user access and permissions. The comprehensive methodology encompasses database design, real-time integration, and adherence to non-functional requisites, supported by Data Flow Diagrams illustrating intricate user interactions and data flows. Security is upheld through Firebase Authentication and data encryption, and Firestore's scalability ensures responsiveness to varying business scales. By facilitating efficient financial processes and religious compliance, the project addresses both technical and practical aspects of modern business needs._
